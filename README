This code requires Boost.Spirit, Boost.Variant, Boost.Foreach in order to compile.  You can find them here:

     	  	   		 		http://www.boost.org/

Once you have the libraries installed and in your g++ include path, you can compile like so:

g++ -o bf main.cpp brainf_ck.cpp

Then, you'll find the bf binary in your current directory.  If you're using windows (without cygwin), then may God have mercy on your soul.
