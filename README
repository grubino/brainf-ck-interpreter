This code requires Boost.Spirit, Boost.Variant, Boost.Foreach in order to compile.  You can find them here:

     	  	   		 		http://www.boost.org/

Once you have the libraries installed and in your g++ include path, you can compile like so (compiling will take a minute or so):

g++ -o bf main.cpp brainf_ck.cpp

Then, you'll find the bf binary in your current directory.  If you're using windows (without cygwin), then may God have mercy on your soul.

Once you have the bf binary, just type:

./bf <brainf_ck source file> 

At a command prompt.  I have included a couple of brainf_ck source files with this interpreter for testing.  One is from http://esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/utils/mandelbrot/ and the other is by Clifford Wolf http://www.clifford.at/bfcpu/.

Let me know if you find any bugs or have any suggestions!
Enjoy!
